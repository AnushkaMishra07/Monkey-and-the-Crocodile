Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away lived two species - monkeys and crocodiles .
The monkeys were the smart ones , the administrators ,the scientists , the rulars etc.
the crocodiles however were the stronger ones ,the gaurdians , the protecters.
Both the species lived in harmony for millions of years untill...............


The crocodiles started to evolve and slowly turned into barbarians they needed more food to 
survive and statrted killig the wildlife. Slowly but steadily the wildlife started dwindling .
the monkeys on the other hand were prospering like never befor they were evolving into smarter 
creatures which ended up calling themselves humans (shhh, they are very self sufficent,this made
 the crocodiles very insecure).....


The leader of the crocodiles suggested that they should eat up all the monkeys so that ultimately 
crocodiles can rule the solar system ....
The plan was made, the leading crocodiles were selected all was ready .......

The ruler monkey with a few more important monkeys were invited to a dinner to promote frienship (or so 
thought the monkeys)

Now before we move forward an interesting tidbit "it is written in ancient texts that the key to 
destroy monkeys is through their heart"

Anyway getting back, as soon as the monkeys all reached the dinning hall the big glass gates were shut
and the chandilier was cut the crocodile incharge told the confounded guests that the crocodiles plan to
eat their hearts. The rular monkey recognised the trouble and said "Well,you may eat our bodies but 
how will you eat our heart ?.I hope you know monkeys don't wear their heart while eating and as this was
supposed to be a dinner none of us have got our hearts "
The crocodile leader was visibly panicking, he couldn't fail this mission.
